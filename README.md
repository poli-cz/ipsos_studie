# Ipsos Studie – Synthetic Respondents vs Real Survey Data

## Overview
This repository contains code and data for a project exploring **AI-generated synthetic survey respondents** in comparison to real survey data from an Ipsos study. The purpose of the project is to evaluate how accurately modern AI models can simulate human respondents (“silicon samples”) in market research. Specifically, it compares survey results generated by a Large Language Model (OpenAI’s GPT-4 via ChatGPT) and a neuro-symbolic AI platform (Lakmoos AI) against actual responses collected through an **Ipsos Instant Research** survey. The scope of the analysis covers key demographic and behavioral variables (e.g., age, gender, income, education, energy usage, political preferences) to assess differences in distributions, biases, and overall accuracy of the AI-generated data compared to the real data.

## Repository Contents
- **data/**: Folder containing datasets used in the analysis. Key files include:
  - `gpt_plain.csv` – Synthetic survey responses generated by GPT-4 (ChatGPT) without additional conditioning. Each row represents a respondent profile with answers to survey questions (demographics and other survey items).
  - `lakmoos_clones_500.csv` – Synthetic survey responses generated by the **Lakmoos AI** platform (a neuro-symbolic AI system). This file contains a "silicon sample" of respondents intended to mirror the real survey population. (The suffix "_500" indicates the sample size or version.)
  - *Note:* The actual human survey data from Ipsos is **not directly included** in this repository due to confidentiality. Instead, key statistics from the real survey (means, distributions) are used within the analysis code as reference values.
- **analysis.py**: Python script that loads the synthetic datasets and performs comparative analysis. It standardizes column names, imputes any missing data, and then conducts statistical tests comparing the AI-generated data to reference metrics (derived from the real Ipsos survey). The script calculates:
  - **Numerical comparisons**: for continuous variables (e.g., Age, Income, Energy consumption), it performs one-sample t-tests against the known population mean and computes effect sizes (Cohen’s *d*).
  - **Categorical comparisons**: for categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Education level, Political preference), it performs chi-square tests against the expected distribution and computes Cramér’s V to gauge effect size.
  - Results are printed in tabular format (using the `tabulate` library) to summarize differences between each synthetic dataset and the reference data.
- **gpt_generator.py**: Python script for generating synthetic respondent data using OpenAI’s GPT-4 API. This script defines prompts (in Czech) to create a random respondent profile from the Czech Republic, and calls the GPT-4 model via an Azure OpenAI endpoint. It handles conversation history and repeatedly queries the model to build a dataset of AI-generated respondents. Use this if you wish to regenerate or extend the synthetic data:
  - **Usage**: You will need to insert your API key and endpoint URL in the script configuration (placeholders are provided as `GPT4V_KEY` and `GPT4V_ENDPOINT`). Running the script will then contact the GPT-4 service and output synthetic survey responses in JSON/CSV format (matching the structure of `gpt_plain.csv`).
  - *Dependencies*: This script relies on the `requests` library to make HTTP calls. Ensure you have network access and proper API credentials before running.
- **todo.txt**: A plain text file with project notes and to-do items. It outlines next steps or questions for further analysis (for example, deciding which comparative stats to show for certain variables like personality traits or energy consumption, and obtaining reference distributions for those). This is more of a working document for development purposes.

## Data Access and Usage
To explore or use the data, simply clone or download the repository. The synthetic datasets in the **data/** folder are provided in CSV format:
- You can open the CSV files with any spreadsheet software or load them into Python (e.g., using pandas) to inspect the contents. Each dataset contains multiple columns corresponding to survey questions (demographics and possibly other responses).
- To reproduce the analysis, ensure you have Python 3 installed along with the required libraries (see **Requirements** below). Then run the analysis script:
  ```bash
  python analysis.py
